After days of trials and whispers, Elara reached the crescent-shaped glade at the map’s heart, where moonlight kissed an ancient stone altar. Guided by instinct and the soft hum of the forest, she placed the map upon it. The woods stirred—trees straightened, flowers bloomed, and the air warmed with life. A hidden spring bubbled forth, its waters rich with magic long lost. When Elara returned to Elderglen, crops flourished, rivers ran clear, and sickness vanished. The villagers, once fearful of the forest, now revered it. And at the edge of the woods, Elara and Shadow watched as life began anew.
