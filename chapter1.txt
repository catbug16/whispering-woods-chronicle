In the quiet village of Elderglen, nestled at the edge of the ancient Whispering Woods, life followed the slow rhythm of the seasons—until the day young Callen discovered the map. Hidden beneath the floorboards of his grandfather’s cottage, the brittle parchment pulsed with strange warmth, its inked symbols shifting ever so slightly when unobserved. Whispers, soft as wind through pine, began to haunt his dreams, speaking of forgotten paths and shadowed ruins deep within the forest. Most feared the woods for the stories they told—but Callen, clutching the map, felt something else entirely: a calling he could no longer ignore.

Elara unrolled the brittle map with trembling fingers, her breath catching as she traced the winding paths inked in a shade of deep emerald. Symbols she didn’t recognize marked places she’d only heard of in bedtime stories—The Mirror Pool, The Hollow Tree, and at the very center, a crescent-shaped glade pulsing faintly with magic. Along the edge, written in curling script, were the words: *“Only the seeker who listens may find what was lost.”* Her pulse quickened. It wasn’t just a map—it was a call, one that tugged at something ancient and restless in her bones.

By dawn, Elara had packed a satchel with bread, a water flask, and her father’s old compass. The village slept on, unaware that one of their own was about to step where no one had dared in generations. As she approached the edge of the Whispering Woods, the trees swayed though there was no breeze, their leaves rustling like distant whispers. She hesitated for only a moment before stepping past the tree line, the map clutched tightly in her hand. The woods exhaled softly around her—as if they, too, had been waiting.

As Elara walked into the Whispering Woods, the air grew cooler, thick with the scent of moss and something ancient she couldn’t name. Sunlight fractured through the dense canopy in pale shafts, casting shifting patterns on the forest floor. Every branch seemed to lean in, every rustle a breath on her neck. Her heart pounded—not from fear, but anticipation. This was the place from every whispered tale, every warning, and yet it felt strangely familiar, like a forgotten melody returning. With the map in hand and courage in her chest, she took her first step deeper into the unknown.
